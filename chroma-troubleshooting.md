# ChromaDB Migration Troubleshooting

To resolve issues caused by the ChromaDB migration and the DuckDB dependency, please make the following code changes:

## Code Changes

1. **Update Python Version Requirement**
   - Update `pyproject.toml`:
     ```toml
     requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"
     ```
   - This change allows the package to be installed with Python 3.12.x.

2. **Remove DuckDB Dependency**
   - Remove from `pyproject.toml` under `[project]` section:
     ```toml
     "duckdb<0.9.0",
     ```
   - Remove from `requirements.txt`:
     ```
     duckdb<0.9.0
     ```

3. **Update ChromaDB Dependency**
   - Update `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`:
     ```toml
     "chromadb>=0.5.21",
     ```

## Why These Changes?

- **Adjust Python Version Compatibility:** Expanding `requires-python` to `<3.13` allows installation with Python 3.12.x, resolving version mismatch errors.
- **Remove Obsolete Dependencies:** Since ChromaDB no longer relies on DuckDB for metadata storage, removing DuckDB eliminates conflicts and unnecessary package installations.
- **Update ChromaDB to Latest Version:** Ensures compatibility with ChromaDB's latest changes, including migration from DuckDB to SQLite.

## Installation Command

After making these changes, run the installation command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This should install the packages successfully with updated configurations.

## Additional Context: DuckDB Issue

The build process for DuckDB's Python package is failing due to a C++ extension incompatibility with Python 3.12. The error occurs in `src/vector_conversion.cpp` due to the removal of the `PyUnicode_WCHAR_KIND` in Python 3.12.

## Recommended Solution

1. **Remove the DuckDB Dependency**
   - DuckDB is incompatible with Python 3.12 and no longer required by ChromaDB.

2. **Update ChromaDB to Latest Version**
   - Ensure it does not depend on DuckDB and is compatible with Python 3.12.

3. **Adjust Python Version Requirement**
   - Enable installation compatibility with Python 3.12.x by adjusting `requires-python`.

4. **Verify Code Compatibility**
   - Ensure your code isn't directly depending on DuckDB.

5. **Run Installation Again**
   - Execute the updated installation command.

6. **Handle ChromaDB Migration**

   - **Install the Migration Tool:**
     ```bash
     pip install chroma-migrate
     ```
   - **Run the Migration Tool:**
     ```bash
     chroma-migrate
     ```

7. **Test Your Application Thoroughly**
   - Verify functionality, especially database operations and ChromaDB interactions.

### Summary

Remove DuckDB and update ChromaDB to eliminate Python 3.12 incompatibility. Adjust the Python version requirement. Handle any necessary ChromaDB data migration steps.

## Examples

### Updated `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[project]
name = "babylon"
version = "0.2.0"
description = "A game system modeling societal contradictions and power dynamics"
requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"
dependencies = [
   "xmlschema>=2.0.0",
   "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
   "matplotlib>=3.0.0",
   "networkx>=2.0.0",
   "pytest>=6.0.0",
   "pluggy>=1.5.0",
   "chromadb>=0.5.21",
   "sentence-transformers>=2.2.2",
   "tk>=0.1.0",
   "pandas>=1.0.0",
   "sqlalchemy>=1.4.0",
   "psycopg2-binary>=2.8.6"
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

# (Rest of your configuration remains the same)
```

### Updated `requirements.txt`

```
xmlschema>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
networkx>=2.0.0
pytest>=6.0.0
hatchling>=1.26.3
tk>=0.1.0
pandas>=1.0.0
chromadb>=0.5.21
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
sqlalchemy>=1.4.0
psycopg2-binary>=2.8.6
```

## Notes

- **Ensure All Dependencies Are Updated:** Update all dependencies to their latest versions if compatible.
- **Review ChromaDB Release Notes:** Check documentation or release notes for important changes.

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist, try these steps:

- **Check for Cached Builds:**
  ```bash
  pip cache purge
  ```
- **Use a Clean Virtual Environment.**
- **Verify Python Version:**
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
- **Seek Support:** Check ChromaDB's Discord or GitHub for similar issues.

By following these steps, you should resolve the installation issues related to DuckDB and Python 3.12 and get your project running smoothly with the updated dependencies.
