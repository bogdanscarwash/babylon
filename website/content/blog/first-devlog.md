We're excited to announce Babylon, a new kind of simulation game that explores how societies evolve through the lens of dialectical materialism. In this first developer log, we'll share our vision for the game and what players can expect.

## Our Vision

Babylon isn't just another city-builder or civilization simulator. It's a deep exploration of how economic systems, social relations, and material conditions interact to drive historical change. Players will witness and participate in the dialectical processes that shape human society.

## Core Features in Development

- Dynamic class relations system
- Economic base simulation
- Superstructure development
- Contradiction resolution mechanics

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue development!
