# Welcome to The Fall of Babylon

## Witness the Collapse. Shape the Future.

The Fall of Babylon is an ambitious text-based simulation that puts you at the heart of a society in crisis. Through the lens of dialectical materialism, you'll navigate complex social, political, and economic systems as you witness—and influence—the collapse of modern America.

### A New Kind of Strategy Game

Unlike traditional strategy games, Babylon simulates the deep interconnections between economics (the Base) and social structures (the Superstructure). Every decision ripples through society, creating emergent stories and unexpected consequences:

- **Dynamic Economy**: Watch markets respond to supply and demand in real-time, as resources become scarce and prices fluctuate
- **Class Struggle**: Navigate tensions between social classes as inequality grows and power dynamics shift
- **Political Upheaval**: Influence elections, manage protests, and respond to civil unrest
- **Crisis Management**: Face cascading disasters, from economic crashes to natural catastrophes
- **Emergent Stories**: Experience unique narratives that arise organically from systemic interactions

### Deep Systems, Real Consequences

Every aspect of society is modeled with intricate detail:

- **Economic Systems**: Production chains, resource distribution, market forces
- **Political Landscape**: Factions, ideologies, power struggles
- **Social Dynamics**: Class relations, cultural shifts, mass movements
- **Legal Framework**: Laws, enforcement, judicial interpretation
- **Technology**: Innovation, automation, unforeseen impacts

### Currently in Development

The Fall of Babylon is being actively developed with a focus on deep simulation and emergent gameplay. Our current roadmap includes:

- Advanced AI-driven simulation
- Complex interaction between economic and social systems
- Dynamic event generation
- Soviet-inspired constructivist interface design
- Extensive modding support
