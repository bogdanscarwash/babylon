# Core Concepts

Babylon is a game that seeks to simulate societal development through the lens of dialectical and historical materialism. These philosophical concepts, originating from Marxist theory, provide the foundation for the game's mechanics and progression.

## Dialectical Materialism

Dialectical materialism is a philosophical approach that views the world as an interconnected and ever-changing system. It emphasizes the importance of material conditions in shaping social reality. In Babylon, this concept is implemented through the following mechanics:

### The Unity and Struggle of Opposites
- Societies in the game are composed of various opposing forces, such as different classes, factions, and ideologies.
- These opposites interact and struggle with each other, leading to conflicts and contradictions that drive societal change.
- Players must navigate and balance these opposing forces to achieve their goals.

### Quantitative Changes Leading to Qualitative Leaps
- As societies develop, they accumulate quantitative changes in their economic, political, and cultural systems.
- At certain thresholds, these quantitative changes lead to qualitative leaps, where the society undergoes significant transformations.
- In the game, players can influence these quantitative changes through their actions and decisions, ultimately triggering qualitative leaps in societal development.

### The Negation of Negation
- Societal development in Babylon follows a dialectical process of negation.
- Each stage of development arises from the negation of the previous stage, incorporating its positive aspects while overcoming its limitations.
- This process of negation and synthesis continues throughout the game, leading to higher stages of societal development.

## Historical Materialism

Historical materialism is an approach to understanding human history that emphasizes the importance of material conditions, particularly economic factors, in shaping social, political, and cultural developments. In Babylon, historical materialism is reflected through the following concepts:

### Modes of Production
- Societies in the game are characterized by their mode of production, which determines the economic base and social relations.
- Players can influence the development of productive forces and relations of production, guiding their society through different modes of production.
- The game includes various modes of production, such as primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and socialism.

### Base and Superstructure
- The economic base of a society, consisting of the productive forces and relations of production, forms the foundation upon which the superstructure (politics, culture, ideology) is built.
- Changes in the economic base lead to corresponding changes in the superstructure.
- Players must manage and develop both the base and superstructure to ensure the stability and progress of their society.

### Class Relations
- Societies in Babylon are divided into different social classes based on their relation to the means of production.
- Class relations and class struggle are fundamental aspects of societal development.
- Players must navigate class conflicts and make decisions that affect the balance of power between different classes.

By incorporating these concepts from dialectical and historical materialism, Babylon aims to provide players with a deep and engaging simulation of societal development. Players will experience the complexities and contradictions of societal change, making choices that shape the trajectory of their civilization.
