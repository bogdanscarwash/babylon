Internal Conflicts:
  Personal contradictions:
    - Contradiction: Persephone struggles with the balance between her high-income job and her commitment to revolutionary ideals.
      Impact: She views her high paying job as a resource. She used to feel a lot of guilt about it, but has since changed her view about it. She now recognizes that being a wealthier person can be a benefit to a movement that doesn't get much funding.
    - Contradiction: She is committed to anti imperialism, but also believs that Russia and China are aspiring imperialists despite them opposing the United States.
      Impact: This makes her feel torn when it comes to issues of accepting foreign assistance or working with foreign states. On one hand, the movement can use that support. On the other hand, we do not want to me making bargains with aspiring imperialists.
