# The Fall of Babylon - Design Document
## Core Concept: The Contradiction System
Based on Mao's On Contradiction, the game models social, economic, and political change through the dynamic interplay of opposing forces.

### Fundamental Principles
1. **Types of Contradictions**
   - Class (workers vs. capitalists)
   - Economic (production vs. demand)
   - Ideological (progressive vs. conservative)
   - National (colonizer vs. colonized)
   - Environmental (exploitation vs. sustainability)

2. **Properties of Contradictions**
   - Principal Contradiction: The dominant conflict driving current events
   - Particularity: Context-specific traits shaped by historical and cultural factors
   - Transformation: Contradictions evolve and influence each other
   - Resolution: Solutions that generate new contradictions

## Game Systems Architecture

### 1. Economic System
- Production and resource management
- Class-based labor mechanics
- Market dynamics and trade
- Crisis mechanics (overproduction, scarcity)

### 2. Political System
- Governance modes (authoritarian, democratic, decentralized)
- Legitimacy mechanics
- Policy implementation
- Diplomatic relations

### 3. Class and Faction System
- Dynamic class relations and consciousness
- Faction interests and alliances
- Internal splits and power struggles
- Revolutionary potential metrics

### 4. Cultural and Ideological System
- Cultural production and hegemony
- Education and propaganda mechanics
- Resistance and counter-culture
- Traditional vs. modern values

### 5. Environmental and Geopolitical System
- Resource extraction and sustainability
- International relations
- Climate and geographic factors
- External interventions

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Contradiction Analysis
- Identification tools
- Intensity metrics
- Resolution options:
  - Suppression (force, propaganda)
  - Reform (negotiation, compromise)
  - Revolution (systemic change)

### 2. Dynamic Events
- Crisis triggers and escalation
- Procedural event generation
- Player response options
- Consequence chains

### 3. Visualization Tools
- Dialectical mapping
- Network relationship displays
- Statistical indicators
- Historical tracking

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Core Systems Integration
- Cross-system feedback loops
- Cascading effects
- Emergence mechanics

### 2. Player Agency
- Decision-making tools
- Strategy options
- Victory conditions:
  - Economic dominance
  - Ideological victory
  - Revolutionary transformation

### 3. Technical Requirements
- Contradiction database
- Event generation system
- Dynamic state tracking
- User interface for system visualization

## Example Gameplay Loop

1. **Initial State**
   - Establish starting conditions
   - Identify principal contradiction

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Monitor contradiction metrics
   - Assess faction positions
   - Evaluate resources

3. **Action Phase**
   - Implement policies
   - Manage resources
   - Respond to events

4. **Resolution Phase**
   - Handle crisis points
   - Process outcomes
   - Generate new contradictions

Note: Each playthrough creates unique narratives through the interaction of systems and player choices, emphasizing the dialectical nature of social change.
