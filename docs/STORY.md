# The Fall of Babylon - Narrative Design Guidelines

## Core Narrative Philosophy

### Emergent Storytelling
- Stories emerge from system interactions rather than linear progression
- Player choices and system states drive narrative development
- Multiple interpretations and outcomes are possible
- Focus on consequences over predetermined paths

### Key Story Elements
1. **Contradictions as Plot Drivers**
   - Social, economic, and political tensions create story opportunities
   - Resolution of contradictions leads to new narrative branches
   - Principal contradictions shape major story arcs

2. **Dynamic World State**
   - Economic conditions influence available stories
   - Political relationships affect possible outcomes
   - Environmental changes create new narrative contexts

3. **Event-Based Narrative System**
   - Events trigger based on game state and player actions
   - Multiple resolution paths for each event
   - Consequences ripple through connected systems
   - Example structure:
     ```python
     story_event = Event(
         id="peasant_uprising_1",
         name="Peasant Unrest in Eastern Provinces",
         description="Growing discontent among peasants threatens stability",
         effects=[...],
         triggers=[
             Trigger(
                 lambda state: state["peasant_satisfaction"] < 30,
                 "Peasant satisfaction drops below critical level"
             )
         ],
         escalation_paths=[
             peaceful_resolution_event,
             violent_uprising_event,
             noble_intervention_event
         ]
     )
     ```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Story Seeds System
- Plant narrative elements based on game state
- Allow stories to grow and evolve naturally
- Multiple potential developments per seed
- Track active and resolved narrative threads

### Story Manager Implementation
```python
class StoryManager:
    def __init__(self, entity_registry, contradiction_analysis):
        self.entity_registry = entity_registry
        self.contradiction_analysis = contradiction_analysis
        self.active_stories = []
        self.story_seeds = []
        
    def update(self, game_state):
        # Check for new story opportunities
        self._evaluate_new_stories(game_state)
        
        # Update active stories
        for story in self.active_stories:
            story.progress(game_state)
            
        # Plant new story seeds
        for seed in self.story_seeds:
            if seed.can_germinate(game_state):
                self._start_new_story_thread(seed, game_state)
```

### Environmental Storytelling
1. **Visual Narrative**
   - Use GUI elements to convey story context
   - Visualization of relationships and tensions
   - Dynamic updates based on game state

2. **Descriptive Text**
   - Rich flavor text for events and situations
   - Context-sensitive descriptions
   - Multiple perspective possibilities

### Player Agency Guidelines

#### Do:
- Provide multiple valid paths through each situation
- Let consequences emerge naturally from systems
- Allow players to ignore or engage with story elements
- Create opportunities for player-driven narratives

#### Don't:
- Force specific plot points
- Lock players into predetermined paths
- Restrict valid play styles
- Hide key information behind story gates

## Story Categories

### System-Driven Stories
1. **Economic Tales**
   - Trade relationships
   - Resource conflicts
   - Class struggles
   - Market dynamics

2. **Political Narratives**
   - Power struggles
   - Diplomatic relations
   - Ideological conflicts
   - Leadership challenges

3. **Social Stories**
   - Cultural changes
   - Population movements
   - Class relations
   - Religious dynamics

### Implementation Examples

#### Contradiction-Based Story
```python
class StoryContradiction(Contradiction):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.story_branches = []
        self.resolved_path = None
    
    def resolve(self, chosen_path):
        self.resolved_path = chosen_path
        # Trigger new events/contradictions based on resolution
```

#### Story Seed
```python
class StorySeed:
    def __init__(self):
        self.potential_developments = []
        self.active_threads = []
        self.resolved_threads = []
    
    def plant(self, game_state):
        """Plant story elements based on current game state"""
        pass
    
    def grow(self, game_state):
        """Evolve story based on player actions and time"""
        pass
```

## Testing & Quality Control

### Narrative Testing
- Verify multiple valid paths exist
- Test system-story interactions
- Validate consequence chains
- Check for narrative dead-ends

### Story Metrics
- Track player engagement with story elements
- Measure story branch diversity
- Monitor narrative pacing
- Evaluate player agency opportunities

## Future Considerations
