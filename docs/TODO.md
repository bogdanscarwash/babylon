### 3. Implement Data Loading Mechanism in Python

#### a. Parse XML Files

- **Choose an XML Parser:** Use Python libraries such as `xml.etree.ElementTree` (built-in) or `lxml` (for more advanced features).

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('path_to_your_file.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
```

#### b. Define Data Models

- **Create Classes for Entities:** Define Python classes that represent your game entities, matching the structure in your XML schemas.

```python
class Faction:
    def __init__(self, id, name, ideology_id, resources):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.ideology_id = ideology_id
        self.resources = resources
```

#### c. Load Data into Objects

- **Instantiate Objects:** Write functions to read XML files and create instances of your classes.

```python
def load_factions():
    factions = []
    # Parse XML and populate the factions list
    return factions
```

#### d. Handle Relationships

- **Cross-Link Entities:** After loading all entities, resolve references between them (e.g., assign Ideology objects to Factions based on `ideology_id`).

---

### 4. Set Up the Core Game Logic (Game Engine)

#### a. Design the Game Loop

- **Main Loop Structure:** Implement a loop that will:
  - Display the current game state.
  - Accept player input.
  - Update the game state based on input and AI decisions.
  - Check for end conditions.

```python
while not game_over:
    display_game_state()
    player_action = get_player_input()
    update_game_state(player_action)
    check_for_contradictions()
    ai_take_actions()
    check_end_conditions()
```

#### b. Implement Game Mechanics

- **Contradiction Handling:**
  - **Detection:** Write logic to detect when contradictions arise based on game state changes.
  - **Resolution:** Define how contradictions evolve into crises and affect entities.
- **Entity Interactions:**
  - **Define Rules:** Establish rules for how entities interact (e.g., class struggle mechanics).
  - **Event System:** Create an event system that triggers based on certain conditions.

#### c. State Management

- **Global State Object:** Maintain a global state that keeps track of all entities and their current statuses.
- **Persistence:** Decide if you need to save/load game states for longer sessions.

---

### 5. Integrate AI Components

#### a. Basic AI for Non-Player Entities

- **Rule-Based AI:**
  - Start with simple conditional logic for decision-making.
  - Entities act based on their attributes and current game state.

```python
def ai_take_actions():
    for faction in factions:
        if faction.resources < threshold:
            faction.take_action('acquire_resources')
```

#### b. Advanced AI with Language Models

- **Local AI Models:**
  - If you plan to use AI like GPT, consider using a local model for offline capabilities.
- **Model Integration:**
  - Use libraries like `transformers` from Hugging Face to load and interact with models.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='model_name')

def generate_ai_decision(prompt):
    return generator(prompt)
```

- **Context Management:**
  - Use the vector database to retrieve relevant embeddings.
  - Limit the context to stay within token limits.

#### c. Vector Database Setup

- **Choose a Library:**
  - Use Faiss, Annoy, or Spotify Annoy for vector similarity search.
- **Store Embeddings:**
  - Create embeddings for your game entities.
  - Store them in the vector database.
- **Retrieve Relevant Data:**
  - When needing context for AI decisions, retrieve top-N similar entities.

---

### 6. Develop the Terminal-Based User Interface

#### a. Input Handling

- **Command Parsing:**
  - Accept input from the player in the form of commands.
  - Parse and validate the commands.

```python
def get_player_input():
    command = input('Enter your action: ')
    # Parse command
    return parsed_command
```

#### b. Output Display

- **Information Presentation:**
  - Clearly display relevant game information to the player.
  - Use text formatting to enhance readability (e.g., headings, lists).
- **Feedback Messages:**
  - Provide feedback based on player actions and game events.

#### c. User Experience Enhancements

- **Clear Instructions:**
  - Provide help commands or instructions to guide the player.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Gracefully handle invalid inputs and unexpected situations.

---

### 7. Testing and Iteration

#### a. Unit Testing

- **Test Individual Components:**
  - Write tests for your data loading functions, game logic methods, and AI components.
- **Use unittest or pytest:**
  - Leverage Python testing frameworks to organize and run your tests.

#### b. Integration Testing

- **Test Interactions:**
  - Ensure that different parts of your code work together as intended.
- **Simulate Scenarios:**
  - Create test cases that simulate game scenarios to check overall functionality.

- **.gitignore:**
  - Update your .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., temporary files, virtual environment folders).

---

### 9. Set Up the Execution Environment

#### a. Virtual Environment

- **Create a Virtual Environment:**
  - Use venv or conda to isolate your project's dependencies.

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### b. Dependencies

- **List Dependencies:**
  - Create a requirements.txt or use pyproject.toml to list required packages.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### c. Entry Point Script

- **Main Execution Script:**
  - Create a main.py or use src/babylon/__main__.py to serve as the entry point.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Initialize game and start the game loop
    main()
```

---

### 10. Additional Considerations

#### a. Security Measures

- **Input Validation:**
  - Ensure that all user inputs are validated to prevent crashes or security issues.
- **AI Safety:**
  - If using AI models, implement measures to handle inappropriate or unintended content generation.

#### b. Performance Optimization
