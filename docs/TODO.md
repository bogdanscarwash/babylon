## Next Steps in Development

With the foundational setup complete, including data structures and initial game logic, we will now focus on implementing core game mechanics and expanding features as outlined in `IDEAS.md` and `MECHANICS.md`. This updated plan will guide the next phase of development:

---

### 1. Implement Core Game Mechanics

#### a. Contradiction Analysis System [x]
- Design algorithms to identify and track contradictions within the game world [x]
- Implement intensity metrics for contradictions [x]
- Develop resolution options: Suppression, Reform, Revolution [x]

#### b. Dynamic Event Generation  []
- Create procedural generation logic for events based on contradictions [x]
- Implement consequence chains that affect the game world []
- Design event triggers and escalation paths []

#### c. Visualization Tools
- Develop dialectical mapping interfaces [x]
- Build network relationship displays [x]
- Create statistical indicators and historical tracking []

---

### 2. Populate Your Game World with Initial Data

#### a. Create XML Data Files

- **Instantiate Game Entities:** For each schema, create corresponding XML files in `src/babylon/data/xml/` that define your initial game entities.
  - **For example:**
    - **Factions:** Define the initial factions with their attributes and relationships.
    - **Social Classes:** Specify the characteristics of each class.
- **Examples Directory:** Use the examples directories to store sample data and expand upon them.

#### b. Data Integration

- **Link Entities:** Ensure that your entities are interconnected using IDs. For instance, factions should reference the ideologies they adopt.
- **Ensure Completeness:** Make sure that all necessary attributes are filled to prevent null references during game execution.

---

### 3. Implement Data Loading Mechanism in Python

#### a. Parse XML Files

- **Choose an XML Parser:** Use Python libraries such as `xml.etree.ElementTree` (built-in) or `lxml` (for more advanced features).

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('path_to_your_file.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
```

#### b. Define Data Models

- **Create Classes for Entities:** Define Python classes that represent your game entities, matching the structure in your XML schemas.

```python
class Faction:
    def __init__(self, id, name, ideology_id, resources):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.ideology_id = ideology_id
        self.resources = resources
```

#### c. Load Data into Objects

- **Instantiate Objects:** Write functions to read XML files and create instances of your classes.

```python
def load_factions():
    factions = []
    # Parse XML and populate the factions list
    return factions
```

#### d. Handle Relationships

- **Cross-Link Entities:** After loading all entities, resolve references between them (e.g., assign Ideology objects to Factions based on `ideology_id`).

---

### 4. Set Up the Core Game Logic (Game Engine)

#### a. Design the Game Loop

- **Main Loop Structure:** Implement a loop that will:
  - Display the current game state.
  - Accept player input.
  - Update the game state based on input and AI decisions.
  - Check for end conditions.

```python
while not game_over:
    display_game_state()
    player_action = get_player_input()
    update_game_state(player_action)
    check_for_contradictions()
    ai_take_actions()
    check_end_conditions()
```

#### b. Implement Game Mechanics

- **Contradiction Handling:**
  - **Detection:** Write logic to detect when contradictions arise based on game state changes.
  - **Resolution:** Define how contradictions evolve into crises and affect entities.
- **Entity Interactions:**
  - **Define Rules:** Establish rules for how entities interact (e.g., class struggle mechanics).
  - **Event System:** Create an event system that triggers based on certain conditions.

#### c. State Management

- **Global State Object:** Maintain a global state that keeps track of all entities and their current statuses.
- **Persistence:** Decide if you need to save/load game states for longer sessions.

---

### 5. Integrate AI Components

#### a. Basic AI for Non-Player Entities

- **Rule-Based AI:**
  - Start with simple conditional logic for decision-making.
  - Entities act based on their attributes and current game state.

```python
def ai_take_actions():
    for faction in factions:
        if faction.resources < threshold:
            faction.take_action('acquire_resources')
```

#### b. Advanced AI with Language Models

- **Local AI Models:**
  - If you plan to use AI like GPT, consider using a local model for offline capabilities.
- **Model Integration:**
  - Use libraries like `transformers` from Hugging Face to load and interact with models.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='model_name')

def generate_ai_decision(prompt):
    return generator(prompt)
```

- **Context Management:**
  - Use the vector database to retrieve relevant embeddings.
  - Limit the context to stay within token limits.

#### c. Vector Database Setup

- **Choose a Library:**
  - Use Faiss, Annoy, or Spotify Annoy for vector similarity search.
- **Store Embeddings:**
  - Create embeddings for your game entities.
  - Store them in the vector database.
- **Retrieve Relevant Data:**
  - When needing context for AI decisions, retrieve top-N similar entities.

---

### 6. Develop the Terminal-Based User Interface

#### a. Input Handling

- **Command Parsing:**
  - Accept input from the player in the form of commands.
  - Parse and validate the commands.

```python
def get_player_input():
    command = input('Enter your action: ')
    # Parse command
    return parsed_command
```

#### b. Output Display

- **Information Presentation:**
  - Clearly display relevant game information to the player.
  - Use text formatting to enhance readability (e.g., headings, lists).
- **Feedback Messages:**
  - Provide feedback based on player actions and game events.

#### c. User Experience Enhancements

- **Clear Instructions:**
  - Provide help commands or instructions to guide the player.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Gracefully handle invalid inputs and unexpected situations.

---

### 7. Testing and Iteration

#### a. Unit Testing

- **Test Individual Components:**
  - Write tests for your data loading functions, game logic methods, and AI components.
- **Use unittest or pytest:**
  - Leverage Python testing frameworks to organize and run your tests.

#### b. Integration Testing

- **Test Interactions:**
  - Ensure that different parts of your code work together as intended.
- **Simulate Scenarios:**
  - Create test cases that simulate game scenarios to check overall functionality.

#### c. Playtesting
