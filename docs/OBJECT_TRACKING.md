Q: In an AI with a context window of 200k tokens, realistically how many objects can be tracked at once? How would RAG and vector databases affect this?
=====
ANSWER:
Let's break this down:

 1 Context Window Capacity (200k tokens)

 • Assuming average English tokens are ~4 characters, and typical game object descriptions are 100-500 tokens
 • Basic object (like a simple Entity): ~100 tokens
 • Complex object (like a Contradiction with full relationships): ~300-500 tokens
 • With pure context window: Could track roughly 400-600 simple objects or 200-300 complex objects

 2 With RAG + Vector Database The architecture could be:


 Game Objects in Vector DB
 ↓
 Query for Relevant Objects
 ↓
 Load only needed objects into context
 ↓
 Keep frequently accessed objects in context
 ↓
 Periodically flush less relevant objects back to vector DB


This would allow:

 • Theoretically unlimited total objects in the game
 • 10,000s of objects in vector DB
 • Only relevant subset loaded into context
 • Example distribution:
    • 50k total objects in vector DB
    • ~1000 objects' embeddings queried per turn
    • Top 100-200 most relevant loaded into context
    • 20-30 frequently accessed objects kept in "working memory"

 3 Optimization Strategies

 • Hierarchical summarization of objects
 • Compression of object descriptions
 • Caching frequently accessed relationships
 • Loading only relevant attributes
 • Using reference IDs instead of full descriptions

 4 Practical Limitations

 • Query latency to vector DB
 • Cost of embedding generation
 • Need for coherent context management
 • Risk of context fragmentation
 • Processing overhead for relevance sorting

The key is not trying to load everything at once, but maintaining a dynamic "working set" of objects relevant to the current game state and player actions.
