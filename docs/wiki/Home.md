# Babylon Project Wiki

Welcome to the Babylon Project Wiki! This wiki serves as the central documentation hub for the Babylon project, a dialectical materialist simulation game that models societal development, conflicts, and potential collapse.

## Overview

Babylon (also referred to as "The Fall of Babylon") is a text-based RPG that simulates complex social, political, and economic systems using AI and XML data structures. The project simulates interactions between economic systems (Base) and social structures (Superstructure), with contradictions as the primary driving mechanism for change.

## Key Features

- **Contradiction Analysis System**: Central engine for detecting, tracking, and resolving contradictions
- **RAG System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context management and object retrieval
- **Vector Database Integration**: Efficient storage and retrieval of game objects
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance tracking and optimization
- **XML Data and Validation**: Structured data management

## Navigation
