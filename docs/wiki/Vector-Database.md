# Vector Database

The Vector Database is a critical component of the Babylon project, providing efficient storage and retrieval of game objects based on their semantic similarity. This page documents the implementation and usage of ChromaDB as the vector database solution.

## Overview

The Vector Database enables:
- Semantic search across game objects
- Efficient retrieval of similar entities
- Persistent storage of embeddings
- Batch operations for performance

## ChromaDB Integration

The Babylon project uses ChromaDB with a DuckDB+Parquet backend for efficient local storage and querying. The implementation is found in `src/babylon/data/chroma_manager.py`.

### Key Features

#### Singleton Pattern

The `ChromaManager` class implements the Singleton pattern to ensure only one ChromaDB client exists throughout the application lifecycle:

```python
def __new__(cls) -> "ChromaManager":
    if cls._instance is None:
        cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
    return cls._instance
```

#### Lazy Initialization

The client is only created when first needed, optimizing resource usage:

```python
@property
def client(self) -> chromadb.Client:
    if self._client is None:
        self._initialize_client()
    return self._client
```

#### Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling with retries for transient failures:

```python
@retry_on_exception(
    max_retries=3, delay=1, exceptions=CHROMA_RETRYABLE_EXCEPTIONS, logger=logger
)
def _initialize_client(self) -> None:
    # Implementation...
```

#### Resource Management

The `cleanup` method ensures proper resource management and data persistence:

```python
def cleanup(self) -> None:
    if self._client:
        try:
            self._client.persist()
            self._client.reset()
            self._client = None
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error during ChromaDB cleanup: {e}")
```

### Integration with RAG System

The Vector Database integrates with the RAG system to provide:
- Storage for embeddings generated by the `EmbeddingManager`
- Efficient retrieval of semantically similar objects
- Persistent storage between application runs

## Current Status

### Completed

- Implemented `ChromaManager` with singleton pattern
- Added DuckDB+Parquet backend
- Implemented lazy initialization
- Added connection pooling
- Implemented caching system

### Pending

- Optimize batch operations
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- Add performance monitoring dashboards

## Usage

### Creating a Collection

```python
manager = ChromaManager()
collection = manager.get_or_create_collection("entities")
```

### Adding Documents with Embeddings

```python
collection.add(
    documents=["Document content..."],
    embeddings=[[0.1, 0.2, ...]], # From EmbeddingManager
    ids=["doc1"]
)
```

### Querying Similar Documents

```python
results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[0.1, 0.2, ...]],
    n_results=5
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- The DuckDB+Parquet backend provides efficient local storage and querying
- Connection pooling improves query performance
- Caching frequently accessed collections reduces database load
- Batch operations improve throughput

## Next Steps

1. Optimize batch operations for better performance
2. Enhance error recovery mechanisms for improved reliability
3. Add performance monitoring dashboards for better observability
4. Implement automated backup and restore functionality
