# The Fall of Babylon

## Overview

The Fall of Babylon is a text-based role-playing game that simulates complex social, political, and economic systems through the lens of Marxist theory and dialectical materialism. The game models the interplay between the **Base** (economic structures) and **Superstructure** (ideologies, political systems, cultures, institutions) of society, with **Contradiction** as the fundamental gameplay mechanic.

## Project Goals

- Create an educational platform exploring Marxist concepts and societal change
- Build a dynamic simulation of economic conditions, class relations, and ideological struggles
- Enable meaningful player agency through strategic decisions and systemic interactions
- Generate emergent narratives from game systems and player choices

## Core Systems

### Base Structures

- **Economic System**
  - Production units (factories, farms, mines)
  - Resources and commodities
  - Labor and capital relations
  
- **Social Classes**
  - Class definitions and relationships
  - Class consciousness and mobility
  - Faction dynamics and alliances

- **Geographic Elements**
  - Cities and regions
  - Resource distribution
  - Population demographics

### Superstructure Elements

- **Ideological Framework**
  - Political philosophies
  - Cultural values
  - Religious beliefs

- **Institutions**
  - Government bodies
  - Educational systems
  - Legal frameworks
  - Cultural organizations

### Contradiction System

- **Types**
  - Antagonistic vs non-antagonistic
  - Principal vs secondary
  - Internal vs external

- **Properties**
  - Intensity levels
  - Resolution conditions
  - Transformation paths

- **Effects**
  - Crisis generation
  - Social changes
  - Historical developments
