    This class extends BaseConfig to provide development-specific settings.
    It enables features that are helpful during development but should
    not be enabled in production.

    Class Attributes:
        DEBUG (ClassVar[bool]): Enable debug mode for detailed error messages

    Note:
        This configuration automatically enables DEBUG mode and may include
        other development-friendly settings that would be inappropriate
        for production use.
